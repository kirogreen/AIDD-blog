    "content": "📄 Summary of the Paper\nTitle: Connecting chemical and protein sequence space to predict biocatalytic reactions\nObjective: To enable the prediction of compatible enzyme-substrate pairs for biocatalytic reactions, reducing reliance on trial-and-error experimentation.\nApproach:\nLibrary Construction (akGLib1): Curated a diverse library of 314 α-KG-dependent NHI enzymes from over 265,000 sequences using bioinformatics tools (e.g., EFI-EST, sequence similarity networks). Ensured high sequence diversity (average identity: 13.7%) and included both characterized and uncharacterized enzymes. High-Throughput Experimentation: Screened 111 diverse substrates against the enzyme library in a 96-well plate format. Discovered 215 new biocatalytic reactions, including hydroxylation, desaturation, and oxidative cleavage. 38% of enzymes and 32% of substrates showed activity, including complex natural products and pharmaceuticals. Machine Learning Model Development: Combined new and literature data into BioCatSet1 (354 reactions). Built two gradient-boosted machine learning models: Substrate-to-enzyme: Predicts which enzymes are likely to react with a given substrate. Enzyme-to-substrate: Predicts which substrates a given enzyme is likely to transform. Used chemical descriptors (MORFEUS) and sequence similarity (SSN) as inputs. CATNIP Web Tool: Developed an open-access web platform (CATNIP) that allows users to input a substrate or enzyme sequence and receive ranked predictions for compatible partners. Validated predictions experimentally with high success rates (e.g., 7 out of 10 predicted enzymes converted sparteine). 💡 Key Innovations\nFirst Large-Scale Mapping of chemical and protein sequence space for a mechanistically diverse enzyme family. Integration of High-Throughput Experimentation with Machine Learning to generate a robust, experimentally validated dataset. Dual-Purpose Predictive Models that work in both directions: from substrate to enzyme and vice versa. CATNIP Platform: A user-friendly, open-access tool that democratizes biocatalytic reaction prediction. High Success Rate: Demonstrated predictive power with real-world substrates and enzymes, including previously uncharacterized ones. 🧪 Possible Applications\nDrug Discovery \u0026 Pharmaceutical Synthesis: Accelerate the development of biocatalytic routes for complex molecules. Green Chemistry: Enable more sustainable synthesis pathways using enzymes. Enzyme Engineering: Guide protein engineering by identifying promising starting points. Metabolic Engineering \u0026 Natural Product Biosynthesis: Predict and design pathways for producing valuable compounds. Educational \u0026 Industrial Use: CATNIP can be used in academic and industrial R\u0026D to quickly identify viable biocatalytic steps. ✅ Conclusion\nThis work represents a major step toward predictive biocatalysis, reducing the time, cost, and risk associated with enzyme discovery and application. By bridging chemical and protein sequence space with data-driven models, the authors provide a scalable framework that can be extended to other enzyme families and reaction types, paving the way for broader adoption of biocatalysis in synthetic chemistry.",
