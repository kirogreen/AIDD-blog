## 1. Summary:
**Title:** De novo design of RNA and nucleoprotein complexes  
**Journal:** bioRxiv (preprint)  
**Publication Date:** October 2, 2025  
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.01.679929  
**Primary Research Institution:** University of Washington, Institute for Protein Design  
**Abstract:** This study introduces RFDpoly, a generative diffusion framework for de novo design of RNA, DNA, and protein structures. The authors demonstrate the ability to design novel RNA folds and nucleoprotein complexes, validated experimentally through SHAPE-seq, electron microscopy, and crystallography. This work extends protein design principles to nucleic acids, enabling creation of diverse biomolecular architectures.

## 2. Background:
The core scientific problem addressed is the lack of robust methods for de novo design of nucleic acid tertiary structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes. While significant advances have been made in protein design, nucleic acid design has been limited to three main approaches: (1) structure-independent aptamer generation, (2) secondary structure-based design without 3D geometry consideration, and (3) geometrically constrained origami methods that rely on rigid assumptions. Prior challenges included inability to capture native-like RNA complexity (multi-angled junctions, bulges, bent helices), limited structural diversity in generated designs, and absence of experimental validation for computational approaches.

## 3. Research Methodology:
The technical roadmap involves a two-step process:

1. **Backbone generation** using RFDpoly, an extension of RFdiffusion that:
   - Denoises frame rotations and translations while predicting torsion angles
   - Uses polymer-class conditioning (RNA/DNA/protein) through RoseTTAfold's 1D track
   - Incorporates base-pair conditioning through 2D templates for secondary structure control
   - Handles multi-polymer generation with symmetric noise propagation

2. **Sequence design** using either:
   - NA-MPNN (nucleic acid version of ProteinMPNN) followed by PyRosetta repacking
   - Autoregressive sequence-structure co-design during denoising

The authors validated designs through:
- SHAPE-seq for secondary structure validation
- Negative stain and cryo-EM for tertiary structure characterization
- Crystallography for atomic-level validation
- Yeast display binding assays for protein-DNA interactions

## 4. Innovations:
Key innovations include:

1. **Generalized biopolymer design**: First framework capable of designing RNA, DNA, and protein structures within a unified architecture
2. **Advanced conditioning**: Base-pair templating with explicit control over pairing patterns, orientations, and pseudoknot topologies
3. **Full-atom generation**: Torsion angle prediction enabling complete backbone construction without post-processing
4. **Hierarchical design**: 2D motif templating allowing scaffolding of pre-characterized components into larger assemblies
5. **Experimental validation**: Comprehensive validation across multiple techniques demonstrating physical accuracy

## 5. Applications:
The findings enable numerous applications in drug discovery and biological research:

1. **RNA therapeutics**: Design of stable RNA structures for siRNA, mRNA vaccines, and RNA-based therapeutics
2. **Biosensors**: Creation of RNA-based sensors and riboswitches for diagnostic applications
3. **Gene regulation**: Design of synthetic RNA regulators for controlling gene expression
4. **Nanotechnology**: Construction of complex nucleoprotein assemblies for nanoscale devices
5. **Structural biology**: Generation of novel RNA folds for studying structure-function relationships

Specific examples from the paper include:
- Designed RNA pseudocycles with novel folds validated by cryo-EM
- Protein-DNA complexes with nanomolar binding affinity
- Successful participation in Eterna OpenKnot challenges with improved folding over natural sequences

## 6. Limitations & Future Work:
The authors acknowledge several limitations:

1. **Prediction reliability**: Need for more reliable tertiary structure prediction methods for protein-nucleic acid assemblies
2. **Interface design**: Limited capability for designing compact, partner-specific protein-RNA interfaces
3. **Chemical diversity**: Lack of incorporation of noncanonical nucleotides and post-synthetic modifications
4. **Dataset size**: Relatively small training dataset of experimentally determined RNA structures

Future directions suggested:
- Development of RNA-centric scaffolds for hierarchical assembly
- Incorporation of small-molecule ligands and chemical modifications
- Expansion to more diverse nucleic acid geometries and functions
- Integration with experimental characterization pipelines

## 7. Jargon Breakdown:

**Diffusion models**: Generative AI approach that learns to denoise structures from random noise. Important for creating diverse, novel structures. Example: RFDpoly starts from random noise and gradually builds structured RNA backbones.

**Base-pair templating**: Method to specify desired base-pairing patterns during generation. Important for controlling secondary and tertiary structure. Example: Providing dot-bracket notation to generate specific pseudoknot topologies.

**SHAPE-seq**: Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing. Important for experimental validation of RNA secondary structure. Example: Measuring nucleotide flexibility to distinguish paired vs. unpaired regions.

**Motif scaffolding**: Approach to incorporate known structural motifs into larger designs. Important for hierarchical design and reusing validated components. Example: Embedding DNA-binding proteins into larger nucleoprotein assemblies.

**TM-score**: Metric for measuring structural similarity (0-1 scale). Important for assessing design quality. Example: Comparing designed structures to predicted folds with TM-score >0.5 indicating good agreement.

## 8. Connections:
This paper represents a transformative capability rather than an incremental improvement in AIDD. It bridges two previously separate fields: protein design and nucleic acid design, enabling truly integrated biomolecular design. The work extends the success of diffusion-based protein design (RFdiffusion) to nucleic acids, creating the first generalized framework for multi-polymer design. This enables entirely new classes of biomolecules that were previously inaccessible to computational design, particularly complex RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid hybrids with precise geometric control.

**The method presented in this paper has been open-sourced.** The authors state that code and weights for RFDpoly will be made available on GitHub at the time of publication, along with tutorial notebooks for all design campaigns described.
